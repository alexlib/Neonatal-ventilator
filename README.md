# Neonatal-ventilator
This example used Simulink and Simscape blocks to simulate a feedback controller that regulates the peak pressure generated by a high-frequency jet ventilator.


The Medical Device community is increasingly looking towards modeling and simulation techniques used in other safety-critical applications to reduce design risks and reduce
probability of device recalls, in an environment of ever-increasing system and software complexity.    Model-Based Design is a design methodology rooted in system modeling and
simulation techniques that have been used for many years by the Aerospace, Automotive and Transportation industries for developing safety critical software systems.
In this example, using a neonatal ventilator model as a case study, youâ€™ll learn to how to apply Model-Based Design techniques to model, simulate, test, implement, and verify your
designs using MATLAB and Simulink.
