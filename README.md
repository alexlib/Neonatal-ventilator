# Neonatal-ventilator
The Neonatal ventilator model uses Simulink and Simscape blocks to simulate a feedback controller that regulates the peak pressure generated by a high-frequency jet ventilator.

It is an example that showcases Model-Based Design techniques to model, simulate, test, implement, and verify your designs using MATLAB and Simulink.
